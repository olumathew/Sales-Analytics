### Project Overview

- How much profit was gotten from the beverages sold?
- How many units of beverages have been sold so far?
- How many Retailers does SodaSpark Beverages have?

- What is the total unit sold for each beverage?
- What are the sales trends over time for these beverages?
- Top 5 states with the most revenue?
- Which regions contributed the most to the revenue?
- Compare the revenue, expenses and profit for each beverage brand

### Results

- There is a clear peak in revenue and expenses around June and July, indicating a seasonal spike, possibly due to summer demand. The revenue generally trends higher than expenses throughout the year
- The total revenue generated is 8.17M, with 1.75M in expenses, resulting in a profit of 6.41M. A total of 16M units were sold across 4 retailers.
- Sodapop significantly outperforms other retailers in terms of revenue.
- Coca-Cola is the top-selling beverage by volume.
- Coca-Cola leads in revenue and profit, significantly outpacing expenses. Dasani Water and Diet Coke also show strong profitability with balanced revenue and expenses.

### Recommendations

- Focus on expanding distribution and promotional efforts with Sodapop and FizzySip, which are the top revenue-generating retailers. Enhancing partnerships with these retailers could amplify sales volume and market penetration, leveraging their established customer base.
- Invest in targeted marketing campaigns for Coca-Cola and Dasani Water, which are the highest-selling brands, especially during peak summer months. Additional marketing support could further boost their market share, particularly when seasonal demand is high.
- Increase sales and marketing efforts in the West and South regions, which have the highest revenue contributions.
- Introduce new beverage flavors or healthier options under the Coca-Cola and Dasani Water brands to attract health-conscious customers or those looking for variety. Diversifying the product line can tap into evolving consumer preferences and expand the customer base.
- Conduct a cost analysis to identify areas where expenses can be reduced without compromising product quality, focusing particularly on brands with lower profit margins. Reducing costs will help increase profitability, especially for lower-performing beverage brands like Fanta and Powerade
